```
Typemaster is meant to be a speed type trainer/aid that does the same work as the original

that want to just look through the project structure or maybe make the application usefull.

The stack is built for **simplicity and modularity**, featuring:
- **Java** as core language, should be installed globaly and added to environment paths
- **Gradle** for project package management, should also be globaly accessible through CMD
- **flatlaff** UI dependency for better and modern UI than the traditional Swing UI that looks old.
- **json** for data representation
